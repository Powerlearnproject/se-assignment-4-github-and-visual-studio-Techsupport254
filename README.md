**Process**:
1. **Create a Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
2. **Make Changes**: Modify, add, or delete files as needed.
3. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement feature"
   ```
4. **Push Branch to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
5. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the repository on GitHub, click "Compare & pull request".
6. **Review and Merge**: After review, merge the pull request into the main branch on GitHub.

#### Pull Requests and Code Reviews

**What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.**

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a feature in GitHub that allows developers to notify team members about changes they’ve pushed to a branch in a repository. It facilitates code reviews and collaboration by enabling discussions and feedback before integrating changes into the main branch.

**Steps to Create a Pull Request**:
1. Push your branch to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
3. Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
4. Click "New pull request".
5. Select the branch with your changes and the base branch you want to merge into.
6. Add a title and description.
7. Click "Create pull request".

**Steps to Review a Pull Request**:
1. Go to the "Pull requests" tab in the repository.
2. Select the pull request to review.
3. Review the changes and provide feedback using comments.
4. Approve the changes or request modifications.
5. Merge the pull request if everything is satisfactory.

#### GitHub Actions

**Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.**

**GitHub Actions** is a feature that allows you to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. These workflows can include tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

**Example of a Simple CI/CD Pipeline**:
1. **Create a Workflow File**: In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `ci.yml`.
2. **Define the Workflow**:
   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     build:

       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Set up Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v2
         with:
           node-version: '14'
       - run: npm install
       - run: npm test
   ```

This example workflow runs on every push or pull request, sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and runs tests.
